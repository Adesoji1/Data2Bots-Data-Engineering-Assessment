1. The `orders` table is linked to the `dim_customers` table through the `customer_id` field.
2. The `orders` table is linked to the `dim_products` table through the `product_id` field.
3. The `orders` table is linked to the `shipments_deliveries` table through the `order_id` field.
4. The `dim_customers` table is linked to the `dim_addresses` table through the `postal_code` field.
5. The `orders` table is linked to the `dim_dates` table through the `order_date` and `calendar_dt` fields.

From the above relationships, we can infer the following foreign key relationships:

1. `customer_id` in `orders` -> `customer_id` in `dim_customers`
2. `product_id` in `orders` -> `product_id` in `dim_products`
3. `order_id` in `orders` -> `order_id` in `shipments_deliveries`
4. `postal_code` in `dim_customers` -> `postal_code` in `dim_addresses`
5. `order_date` in `orders` -> `calendar_dt` in `dim_dates`

So, there are indeed 5 foreign key relationships based on the relationships we've described.

In Addition,
6. The `reviews` table is linked to the `dim_products` table through the product_id field.
7. The `dim_dates` table is linked to the `shipments_deliveries` table through the delivery_date, shipment_date, and calendar_dt fields.
